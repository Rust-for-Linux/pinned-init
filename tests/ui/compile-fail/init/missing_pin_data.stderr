  = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
  = note: the following trait defines an item `__pin_data`, perhaps you need to implement it:
          candidate #1: `HasPinData`
  = note: this error originates in the macro `pin_init` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
help: there is an associated function `__init_data` with a similar name

9 -         pin_init!(Self { a: 42 })
9 +         __init_data
